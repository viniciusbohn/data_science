# Vinícius Bohn Baumgratz

Great experience with Data-Driven Decision Making and Business Intelligence, obtained by playing the role as the Product Owner of many strategic projects inside the defense industry. Also experienced with finding solutions using data analysis, specially aiming to improve processes, in order to remove waste and improve product quality.

I like to take projets from end to end, from the identification of the problem to the deployment of a solution. I'm specialized in using Python and its libraries to extract, clean, explore, and create Machine Learning models to solve problems.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Data-driven Decision Making & Business Intelligence.
